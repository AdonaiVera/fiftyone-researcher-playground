# 🧠 FiftyOne Researcher Playground
👋 *By researchers, for researchers.*

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to:

- Load diverse datasets: **images**, **video**, **point clouds**
- Perform core machine learning tasks: **classification**, **object detection**
- Integrate powerful plugins to:
  - Detect image quality issues
  - Find duplicate images
  - Perform semantic document search
  - Ask visual questions about your data
  - Detect outliers
  - Analyze sparse concepts and potential biases *(by Adonai)*
  - Validate visual-language model (VLM) performance *(by Adonai)*
  - Explore solutions with VoxelGPT *(by Adonai)*
- Evaluate models with built-in metrics

✅ Designed to help researchers improve dataset quality, measure model performance, and experiment with cutting-edge tools.
